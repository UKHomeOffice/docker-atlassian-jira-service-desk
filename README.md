# Atlassian JIRA Service Desk in a Docker container

> Project name: docker-atlassian-jira-service-desk

This project exists in order to enable the deployment of JIRA Service Desk in
the UK Home Office Kubenetes cluster.

This project is based on [Martin Aksel Jensen's](https://github.com/cptactionhank)
project and borrows heavily from that project - many thanks to Martin for Open
Sourcing his work under the MIT License. His project can be found
[on GitHub here](https://github.com/cptactionhank/docker-atlassian-jira-service-desk).

This project is not forked from Martin's project as some modifications may be
required to the `Dockerfile` to ensure certain configuration settings are
maintained and any updates are controlled.
